This MATLAB project allows you to hide secret messages inside an image using the LSB (Least Significant Bit) of the real part of its 2D FFT (frequency domain). 

 Features
- Select any image (.jpg, .png, .bmp)
- Input a secret message to embed
- Stego image generation with Hermitian symmetry maintained
- Save stego image and stego info for extraction
